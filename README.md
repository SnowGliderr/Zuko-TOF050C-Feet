# Zuko-TOF050C-Feet
Mod for Zuko the robot dog.
This mod modifies the lower legs to allow for distance measurements between the bottom of Zuko's paw and the ground, using a TOF050C time-of-flight distance sensor mounted in each foot.

# Hardware
Design modified from v2.1-v24 cad of the Zuko project. 
v1 cad has yet to be tested.
